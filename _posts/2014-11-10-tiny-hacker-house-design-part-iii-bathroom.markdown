As mentioned in a [previous
article]({% post_url 2014-10-22-tiny-hacker-house-design-part-i-overview %}),
my bathroom won't be
just a place to shower & shave -- it'll function as a walk-in closet as well.
If you're in the house with others, it's also the only place where you can lock
a door and reasonably expect some privacy, so I wanted to keep that in mind for
future living arrangements where I may be sharing the house. Because of this,
the bathroom will occupy nearly 1/3 of the lower level space -- approximately
29 sq. ft. of the 103 sq. ft. available.

### Toilet

Since I plan to be off-grid or on the road often with my house, I knew a
standard plumbed-in toilet wouldn't be ideal. I'd have to accommodate a black
water tank underneath the house and deal with finding a spot to empty it every
couple weeks. The next best option seems to be an [incinerating
toilet](http://ssl3.sea.tierpoint.com/incinolet/), but they're pricey and
consume 450 kWh of electricity each use!

I certainly don't want any power problems to prevent pooing, so I'm sticking
with a simple composting toilet for the initial build. What's a composting
toilet, you ask? It's essentially a bucket enclosed in a comfy wooden
toilet-like enclosure. You sprinkle in peat moss or sawdust after each use to
absorb the smell and moisture, and after it's full, you can safely dump the
waste into a compost pile. It seems a bit unsanitary at first, but it's much
more eco-friendly -- 
[toilets consume the most](http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html)
water in a typical home. Plus, in more permanent living situations, the
abundance of fresh compost will come in handy for my garden.

Everything I know about composting toilets is from the [Humanure
Handbook](http://humanurehandbook.com). Definitely worth a read if you're
interested in off-grid or eco-friendly toilets.

### Shower

Whatever the issue in life, long, hot showers always seem to clear the mind to
uncover a solution. I [had originally
planned]({% post_url 2014-08-04-i'm-building-a-tiny-hacker-house %})
to install a lavish freestanding tub, but I've since given up on that plan. A
16' trailer is just too small for that kind of luxury and I can wash clothes in
a shower just as easily. I didn't want to skimp too much on bathing facilities
though, so I managed to come up with something that's small yet comfy:

  <div class="caption">

At just 33"x33", Dreamline makes a beautiful, tiny [shower
kit](http://www.bathauthority.com/shower-enclosure-Prime.html) that fits my
bathroom perfectly. The height of the enclosure is *just right* to create a
floor-to-ceiling seal with my 6' 6" bathroom ceiling, so instead of a
freestanding tub I now have myself a tiny steam room. Success. With a
low-profile rain showerhead to complete the package I'll be basking in
dihydrogen monoxide bliss wherever I go.

### Sink

There are plenty of tiny sinks on the market. Width and height aren't really an
issue in my case, but I'll need plenty of room to move around, change clothes,
etc so I'm keen on finding something low-profile and wall mounted.
[This](http://amzn.com/B00B24HVIM) ALFI AB108 is the sexiest one I've found
but it's pricey especially once you include the optional towel bar. I'll
have enough road issues to deal with -- better not add highway robbery to the
list. The sink search is still on.

### Closet

One thing's for sure: I need to get rid of some clothes before I move into my
tiny house. The hanger rack is only 16" long -- enough room for about 15
clothes hangers. After accounting for a jacket, hoodie, and winter coat, that's
only enough room for about a week's worth of pants and collared shirts.
Bathroom shelves provide a little more storage though, allowing me to avoid
doing laundry for up to two weeks.

I never considered myself to be a packrat, but now that I'm considering
*actually* moving into a tiny house, declaring a spot for *every* little thing
I own, it really dawns on me how little importance I place on acquiring new
material comforts.
