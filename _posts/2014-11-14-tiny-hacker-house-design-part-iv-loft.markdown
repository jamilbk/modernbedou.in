With only 103 sq. ft. to work with, floor space *has* to be optimized. One big
difference I notice between most RVs and tiny houses is the latter usually
takes advantage of a bit higher ceilings to make room for a bedroom loft. It's
a great way to make use of the 13' 6" allowable road height for trailers
without sacrificing valuable floor space for a permanent bed.

Since I'll be either sleeping or reading 99% of the time I'm in bed, I don't
need much headroom. Lucky for me, the wedge shape of my trailer frame allows
for three and a half feet of vertical room at the head of the mattress. Space
is a bit more cramped at the foot of the loft at just over 2 feet to the
ceiling, so I've recessed the loft entrance 28" back to a point where the
clearance is close to 3 feet.

Since the loft is the most confined space in the house, I knew it would need
lots of natural lighting. That's why there's a huge 6' x 3' casement window at
the rear, and two 2' x 2' casement windows on the sides. Skylights seem to be
all the rage in tiny homes, and I've added a large 56" VELUX directly above the
mattress for stargazing on cool, clear nights.  And it opens wide enough to
reach the solar panels for occasional cleaning, so that'll keep me from having
to climb onto the roof.

I'm still trying to figure out the ladder situation. It
[seems](http://tinyhousetalk.com/tiny-house-furniture-1-chair-ladder/) to be
a [common](http://tinyhouselistings.com/tiny-house-uk-unique-loft-ladder/)
point of
[interest](http://tinyhousebuild.com/ridiculously-easy-loft-ladder-for-tiny-houses/)
for most tiny houses. The shelving staircase used in Rocky Mountain Tiny
Houses' [Boulder](http://rockymountaintinyhouses.com/plans/boulder/) plan is
attractive and clever. But I want to be careful about adding permanent stairs;
if I don't use the storage I'll be tempted to tear it down and find a more
efficient way to climb into the loft. Right now the plan is to reinforce the
shelving near the TV to double as a ladder, or build a thin metal ladder that
attaches to the loft edge and tucks away into the pocket door nook when not in
use. We'll see.
