This is the first build post. I actually started building in late November, but
wanting to make some sustained progress before sharing what I've learned.
I knew I wanted to use metal stud framing, but how much more difficult could
this be than traditional stick framing?

Well, it took 2 months and a few false starts to get the steel frame together and
finalized.

My first design used 25-gauge metal studs found in any Home Depot. It didn't
take into account any sort of industry-standard structural building techniques,
but it was fairly easy to assemble:

    </i>
  </div>
</center>

The subfloor could be strapped to the trailer frame with wood hurricane straps!
I thought I was really clever for coming up with this "foundation":

      18-gauge galvanized steel straps holding down the subfloor and eventually
12,000 lbs of house. Haha.
    </i>
  </div>
</center>

Then I found out about the [Prescriptive Method for Residential Cold-Formed
Steel Framing]({{site.baseurl}}/files/steel framing guide.pdf). Apparently, if
you're framing anything with steel, this is the reference to rule them all.
After reading that, I realized I had to trash the subfloor I already built and
order some _real_ metal studs. This meant I needed the precise lengths of all the
tracks and studs I would need in advance. And so I came up with this:

  <div class="caption">
    <i>

    </i>
  </div>
</center>

Once my order of 12-gauge studs and tracks arrived, it was time to start
building! I decided to build my walls on the ground first, then raise them into
place. What could go wrong?

    </i>
  </div>
</center>



Well, it turns out steel bends and flexes pretty easily under its own weight.
Furthermore, the 12-gauge studs I was using required a lot of banging to get
them to slide into the tracks, and they kept popping out. When I finally
screwed them together, this tension added up. When I got the
first three walls up, I noticed things weren't quite right:

  <div class="caption">
    <i>
      Notice the whole frame skewing to the left.
    </i>
  </div>
</center>

Sigh. I'd have to be more careful with the final wall -- making sure it was
nice and square before hoisting it into place.

    </i>
  </div>
</center>

That made a big difference. With the final wall built, I could prepare the
other three so the corners would line up. I goaded the frame back to its
planned shape using a series of ratchet straps:

  <div class="caption">
    <i>
      All four walls up (for now).
    </i>
  </div>
</center>

I then lifted the last wall into place. But just before I was able to screw it
to the others, it came crashing down, nearly flattening me into a tiny human.

After getting the fourth wall back up, I decided to add some cross-structural
bracing and weld all the joints to provide much more rigidity.

  </div>
</center>

Once the frame was done and welded, I still needed to punch 1/2" holes through
the studs to run the electrical wiring and plumbing. I also needed to drill
through the trailer flange to attach my foundation anchors. This took about
a week and 7 cobalt drill bits.

After all that hard work, was it worth using metal studs? Absolutely. Just
maybe not 12-gauge ones. 18-gauge would probably be more suitable and can still
be welded.
