Remember that sweet hacker semi truck from Live Free or Die Hard? When I saw
that movie, I knew at some point in my life I wanted to drive around, connect
to the net, and cause a ruckus with my trusty sidekick / lover. Minus being
destroyed by an F-35.

The urge to go anywhere, bask in solitude, and flesh out some ideas isn't
unique amongst hackers. Henry David Thoreau, founders of stripe, alex maccaw,
etc. Examples abound. So I'm building a tiny hacker house. 

If building a house is hard work, designing one from scratch is long work.
It's an exercise in organization, research, patience, and most of all, soul
searching. You're the primary authority on designing the space that's going to
be the foundation for your foreseeable life. You have to make a decision for
every little thing. In the beginning, it seems simple and easy. But once you
find yourself weighing the trade-offs between one showerhead and the other or
recessed lighting vs wall lamps, you realize just how long the process could
take.

Things are especially involved designing a tiny house on a trailer. Since the
home will be moving, you have to account for the jostle of highway travel,
weight distribution, and whether your house will still be attached after a
screeching emergency stop.  After modeling the house 3 times, each with
different frame dimensions, I've finally arrived at the first rough draft
model. A beta, if you will.

## The Design

I'll go through the design of the house in broad categories. This design is
essentially my blueprints for building the house, and will serve as my
materials list when complete.

### Structure

#### Shape

Since I plan to be fairly mobile with the home, I wanted something more
aerodynamic than the typical A-frame. I really like what Rocky Mountain Tiny
Houses did with their [Boulder
design](http://rockymountaintinyhouses.com/plans/boulder), so I decided to do
something similar. Mine will have a wedge-shaped shed on the tongue of the
trailer which will further enhance its aerodynamic properties.

#### Trailer

Speaking of the trailer, I splurged on a [custom 16'
one](http://www.tinyhomebuilders.com/tiny-house-trailers) from Tiny Home
Builders. It's got tandem 7,000 lb drop-axles so I can load it up without worrying
about overloading it. It sits about 3-4" lower than your typical trailer, which
allows for a higher roof and lower center of gravity.

The empty trailer weighs in at 1950 lbs, so that leaves 12500 lbs capacity for
my house, water, propane, belongings, and people.

#### Frame Material

I originally designed the frame from 25-gauge galvanized steel stud and track,
like what you'd find at your local hardware store. I knew they weren't load
bearing, but I hazarded the guess that they'd suffice if set them 12" OC and attached to 23/32"
sheathing on both sides. Well, I've changed my mind. After more research, it
seems like not only are they structurally inadequate for a tiny house, but the
vibrations from road travel can potentially wiggle the fasteners loose. The
last thing I want to do is hesitate to apply the brakes in an emergency
maneuver for fear of shearing the frame.

As such, I've decided to use metal studs that are designed for load-bearing
applications: [Light Gauge Metal
Studs](http://buildipedia.com/aec-pros/construction-materials-and-methods/light-gauge-metal-stud-framing-planning-and-practices).
These are similar to the standard 25-gauge ones used for wall partitions,
except they're offered in thicker gauges, made of stronger steel, and coated
with up to G90 galvanization. Additionally, they're pre-cut to lengths of
your choosing, so in an ideal world you could order exactly the pieces you need
and assemble it like a giant Lego set, no cutting required! The only downside
is it's much harder to go back and change the design once I've placed the
order.

Using 14-gauge stud / track, the total estimated weight of just the frame comes
in at about 2600 lbs.

#### Sheathing

The exterior, roof, and subfloor will still use 23/32" treated plywood. But
since the frame will actually be doing its job, I can make the rooms slightly
bigger by going with 15/32" plywood for the interior. The sheathing grain will be
oriented orthogonal to the interior / exterior siding, so that would be
left-right for the subfloor and roof, and bottom-up for the walls.

A very exaggerated, maximum estimate for the sheathing weight is 1700 lbs.
