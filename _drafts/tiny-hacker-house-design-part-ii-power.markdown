When I first started contemplating building a tiny house, the electricity
system was the first thing I researched. Maybe that's because it's what I'm
most comfortable with as an electrical / computer engineer, or perhaps it's
because that's what enables the rest of the house to come alive. Since I wasn't
planning to be connected to the grid, I had to depend on my electrical system
more than ever to provide the comforts for everyday life.  If I wanted to rely
on my home office to earn a living, it needed to be fault-tolerant.

At the very minimum, I knew I needed to power A/C, a refrigerator, lights,
internet equipment, and a computer simultaneously. As a bonus, I'd be able to
also turn on a toaster oven or coffee machine too. So I came up with the
following table:

Device | Max power draw (W)
-|-
Laptop | 85
8,000 BTU A/C | 800
Refrigerator | 55
Wireless Router | 11
Lights (4) | 60
|=
Total | 1011

solar panels
generator
power management system
power draw / requirements


Tiny houses are already pressed for space, so I didn't want to feel even more
limited in my daily routine. With ample electricity, you can maintain a cool
70ยบ, cozy 80ยบ, cook your food, watch your movies, connect to the net, and fill
your home with your favorite playlist. Without it, things start to feel limited
