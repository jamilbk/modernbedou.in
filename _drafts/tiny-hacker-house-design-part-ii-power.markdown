When I first started contemplating building a tiny house, the electricity
system was the first thing I researched. Perhaps that's because it's what
enables the rest of the house to come alive, to breathe. You can always add
water, food, and furniture later on; it's much less elegant to hassle with a
generator and extension coords running amuck.

Tiny houses are already pressed for space, so I didn't want to feel even more
limited in my daily routine. With ample electricity, you can maintain a cool
70ยบ, cozy 80ยบ, cook your food, watch your movies, connect to the net, and fill
your home with your favorite playlist. Without it, things start to feel limited
