Hi folks. It's been a while since the last update, but for good reason! I've been
busy building. More on that in another post. But first, I'd like to discuss
plumbing.

Since the tiny hacker house will be heated via a closed-loop in-floor radiant
heat system, the plumbing is a bit more complicated than your typical tiny
house. One heater will need to provide hot water for
both the fixtures and home heating, so a "smarter" system is required to ensure
everything flows properly and stays hot. Unfortunately, that means a bit
of back-of-the-napkin calculations are in order.

A little aside: Unless you're willing to spend hours and hours designing a
system from scratch (and likely still get it wrong), just hire a professional.
I'm only offering here the resources I've found helpful in the hopes it'll be
helpful for other DIY'ers. I certainly wish I had more examples available to
study as I dove into this adventure.

The first order of business to complete is figuring out a "worst case" scenario
for hot water usage. If you have a stationary home with traditional heating,
this is pretty easy -- just throw in one or more electric tank heaters
(depending on the size of your family) and call it day. With mobile homes and
radiant heating, though, it requires answering some imaginative questions. Tank
or Tankless? Planning ski trips? Having house guests? Using an automatic
dish washer? Everyone's scenarios are different; for me, it's taking a piping hot shower in 0&deg;F weather while
maintaining a comfortable 75&deg;F in the house. Boy will it be nice to come
home to heated floors and hot showers after a day on the slopes!

Next, you can begin sizing the primary hot water
components. Each fixture draws a specific amount of water flow from the system,
measured in gallons per minute (GPM). Ideally you want the sum total of these
to be less than what your water heater and pump can provide. If they're not,
you'll experience a drop in flow at one fixture when you turn on another. In reference to my scenario above, the

(there are 2, more on that later) can produce a maximum of about 5 GPM of flow
at around 0 head, which simply means it will be able to 

The state of the
plumbing system can represented by 2 "bits" of information: fixture (shower) on
/ off and radiant floor on / off. So there are four possible states the system
can be in: both off, both on, fixture on, or radiant on. The shower head I'll
be using is 2.4 GPM, and the recirculation pump I plan to use for the system is
an adjustable Taco 003 with a max flow of 8 GPM. The water heater provides a
maximum flow of 6.6 GPM, so I need to adjust the Taco pump to achieve the
difference in flow.

The system will have 3 pumps and 2 tanks:

- radiant floor loop circulation pump
- radiant floor supply circulation pump
- pressurization pump (when coming from tank)
- pressure tank to smooth out water flow
- expansion tank to accommodate radiant floor fluid changes

Taco offers a relay for their pumps to be controlled by a thermostat


When you design and build your own house, it becomes a reflection of who you
are. It's a thorough, fundamental expression of you. So I've realized
